                            <p class = "text text-sm">Reports of the healthcare response to the surge of COVID‐19 cases in Italy (Grasselli et al., 2020) and the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020) highlight the magnitude of the impact of COVID‐19 on the healthcare system. Described as a tsunami of death (Jackson et al., 2020), the mortality 
                                associated with COVID‐19 is unlike anything the current healthcare workforce has seen before.</p>

                            <p class = "text text-sm">Nurses have been at the forefront of the response to the COVID‐19 pandemic and are facing extraordinary circumstances, where mortality is high, and patients have sometimes been dying alone. Restricting family visits, while a necessary measure to decrease the spread of COVID‐19 to vulnerable patients and the community, is likely 
                                to have negative effects on families and nurses alike and these impacts need to be carefully considered.</p>
